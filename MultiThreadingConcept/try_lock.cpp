//0. std::try_lock() tries to lock all the mutex passed in it one by one in given order.
//1. On success this function returns -1 otherwise it will return 0-based mutex index number which it could not lock.
//2. If it fails to lock any of the mutex then it will release all the mutex it locked before.
//3. If a call to try_lock results in an exception, unlock is called for any locked objects before re-throwing.ˀˀˀˀ
